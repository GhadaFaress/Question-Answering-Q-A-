Question Answering (Q&amp;A) system using BERT 
# BERT Question Answering Fine-Tuning on SQuAD v2

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on the SQuAD v2.0 dataset for extractive question answering. It uses Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets to prepare, tokenize, and train a question-answering model.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- âœ… Loads and samples the SQuAD v2 dataset (`train`, `validation`)
- âœ… Preprocesses question/context pairs with start-end token labeling
- âœ… Uses `bert-large-uncased` (or a fine-tuned variant) for QA
- âœ… Trains the model using `Trainer` API
- âœ… Easily adaptable for custom QA datasets
